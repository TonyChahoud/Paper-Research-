This paper was about "LOW NOISE AMPLIFIER FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM "Done on 2017 

the wireless communication becomes more and more important for human life. This result with a huge demand on wireless network access increases the need to reduce the noise figure to very low level. The purpose of LNA (low noise amplifier) is to amplify the RF signals well into acceptable level and minimize the noise as much as possible
In this paper LNA design will be introduced, discussed and explained in details.
